            Most existing vision encoders map images into a fixed-length sequence of tokens, overlooking the fact that different images contain varying amounts of information. 
            For example, a visually complex image (e.g., a cluttered room) inherently carries more information and thus deserves more tokens than a simple image (e.g., a blank wall). 
            To address this inefficiency, We propose <strong>DOVE</strong>, a <strong>D</strong>ynamic <strong>O</strong>utput <strong>V</strong>ision <strong>E</strong>ncoder that produces a variable number of visual tokens (i.e., continuous representation vectors) to reconstruct each image. 
            Our results show that DOVE significantly reduces the average number of tokens while maintaining high reconstruction quality. 
            In several linear probing and downstream multimodal tasks, it outperforms existing autoencoder-based tokenization methods when using far fewer tokens, capturing more expressive semantic features compared to fixed-length encoding. 
            We further extend DOVE with query-conditioned tokenization. By guiding the model to focus on query-relevant regions, it achieves more efficient and targeted semantic extraction.

        DOVE consists of a VQGAN encoder-decoder, a transformer-based dynamic token generator, and a non-autoregressive token decoder. The model first extracts visual features using the VQGAN encoder, combines them with timestep embeddings, and feeds them into the token generator to produce a variable-length sequence of continuous visual tokens. By predicting an EOS token, the model learns to truncate redundant tokens automatically. During training, we jointly optimize image reconstruction quality and EOS prediction, encouraging shorter token sequences while maintaining reconstruction quality.

        We introduce Q-DOVE, an extension of DOVE tailored for text-conditioned vision-and-language tasks. The model reads the user's query and reconstructs the input by focusing on semantically relevant regions, thereby further reducing the length of the generated token sequence.

        We report FID scores of the reconstructed images across varying token lengths. Our results show that as token length increases, the reconstruction quality of our model consistently improves. When using the full token length of 256, our method surpasses VQGAN on both the COCO and WIT datasets.

      <p>
        We also observe an emergent semantic phenomenon: compared to fixed-length autoencoder-based tokenization methods, our dynamic reconstruction approach captures richer semantic information. Q-DOVE further enhances this by incorporating query conditioning. On tasks such as Linear Probing, both DOVE and Q-DOVE significantly outperform other autoencoder-based tokenization methods.

First, pay attention to the weather conditions, as sudden changes in weather, especially strong winds or storms, can cause the water to become rough and pose risks to the stability of the pier. Second, be mindful of the structural integrity of the pier; avoid overloading it with too many people or excessive weight, as this could potentially damage the pier or cause it to collapse. Additionally, be aware of the surrounding wildlife and respect their space; do not harm or disturb them in any way. Finally, if you decide to go fishing, ensure that you adhere to any local fishing regulations and use appropriate fishing techniques to keep the lake ecosystem healthy and maintain the balance of the food chain.â€‹â€‹"],
